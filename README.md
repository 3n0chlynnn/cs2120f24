Here's the initial state of the evolving git repository
for our class. And here are the instructions for getting 
started. If you don't know what something here means (e.g.,
how to fork a repository on GitHub), there are videos all
over Youtube, TikTok, or whatever.

Getting started:

- if you don't have a GitHub account, get one
- Log into your github account
- Navigate in GitHub to this repository
- fork *this/my* GitHub repo (makes a copy in *your* GitHub account)
- navigate back to your account, get the URL for your new repo copy 
- then use that URL to clone *your* fork (on GitHub) onto your laptop
- if you don't already have it, install VSCode
- in VSCode install the lean4 extension
- in VSCode "File > open folder" your new cloned *directory*
- click on Main.lean; VSCode will install Lean
- sometimes you need to tell Lean to re-process a "red" file with CMD/CTRL-SHIFT-P the "Lean4: Restart File"
